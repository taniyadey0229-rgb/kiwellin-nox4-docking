# Kiwellin-NOX4 Docking Project

> Explored Kiwellin’s bioactive properties through protein-protein docking with NOX4 using AutoDock and CLUSPRO, identifying therapeutic potential for oxidative stress-related diseases, enhancing drug discovery for myocardial infarction, metabolic syndromes, and autoimmune conditions.

---

## Methodology

This project aimed to determine the binding affinity between the Kiwellin protein (ligand) and the NOX4 protein (receptor), which is implicated in oxidative stress.

* **Protein Structures:** 3D structures for both proteins (`KIWELLIN.pdb` and `NOX4.pdb`) were obtained.
* **Docking Server:** The protein-protein docking simulation was performed using the **CLUSPRO** web server.

## 🏁 Results

The docking simulation successfully predicted the binding interactions between Kiwellin and NOX4.

The top-ranked model (Model 0), which represented the largest and most favorable cluster, showed a **Weighted Score of -717.3**. This strong negative score suggests a stable and favorable binding interaction, supporting the hypothesis that Kiwellin may interact with NOX4.
